# BurrowsWheeler

This is a GUI for presenting the Burrows Wheeler Transformation. The Burrows Wheeler Transformation is a preprocession algorithm for compression that is primarily used in the BZip2 algorithm and reorders words and letters within them so that they are more suitable for compression.

This is a project for university, so I unfortunately cannot accept foreign pull requests (even though I know that you guys can have amazing ideas, but it's simply no option).
